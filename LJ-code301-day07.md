# LJ Code 301, Day 07

Today we learned about servers, HTTP requests, and more. We also were able to make our own servers. It was very cool! Glad to be starting back end work. I worked with Nathan in the morning, and Gabe in the afternoon. Both were great to work with, and very quick workers. Also, Nate killed me in a game of ping pong :'(
