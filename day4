Learning Journal (Day 4)

Today was exhausting. We did pair programming, and I was matched with Alison. It was difficult because we move at very different speeds (I move very fast on the cpu and she's still getting to know the syntax/logic) and overall things took quite a long time.

I feel like I cemented some knowledge in my head through explaining things to her, which is good, but I honestly feel I would have gained more from today just working on a more difficult assignment not via pair programming. Hard to say. I was looking forward to getting to tweak my website around more style-wise, but didn't get to it.
