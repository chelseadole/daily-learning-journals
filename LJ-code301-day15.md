#LJ Code 301, Day 15

Today we had a lot of lecture again (like that one day last week with the grocery store) but it wasn't as overwhelming this time. Building things from the ground up was, again, very helpful.

Also, Nathan called Seattle AA and was able to get them to email us their excel file of meeting data that we want for our project! So that'll make Monday much easier. We won't have to pull it off their page. :)
