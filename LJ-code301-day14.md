# LJ Code 301, Day 14

Today I deployed my portfolio (lol, it's pretty horrible looking) and we started the pokedex example project in class. So far the pokedex has been a useful group project, though it's (for the better, definitely!) exposing to myself that I don't quite understand the whole process as well as I thought I did.

Some of the parts of the data flow are still unclear to me. I'm glad the project is pushed to github, because I want to be able to review it and understand it better.

We also had our first group meeting for our project, and planned out what we'll be starting on monday. Looks like we're aiming high â€” but I find that exciting :)
