# LJ Code 201 - Day 1

Today was a manageable day! Day 2 overall went well. Yesterday was lot for me, because we spent until... nearly 5pm, I think, in the classroom in a lesson. But having about 3 hours of lecture plus a few hours of work is more doable, especially since we're still early in the course so I'm not dying yet.

We learned how to properly connect HTML, CSS, and JS files, about array/data types, and some other CSS lingo. So far I find the logic of JS to be pretty easy, given my previous coding background. However, I actually find CSS more difficult. I didn't use it in my About Me project, but I still don't really understand how to make boxes floats, and how to make side columns, etc. Oh well. I guess I'll figure it out eventually.

Looking forward to tomorrow, and glad to be leaving at around 4:30pm with my work completed. (With the exception of reading, at least.)
