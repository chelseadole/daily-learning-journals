# LJ 301 Day 04

Today was a fairly good day. Mark and I worked together for the pair programming segment, which we found quite difficult. I had more trouble working through it today than in past days, and our teamwork was good, but we had a *lot* of trouble figuring out the whole concatenation part.

Handlebars seems useful. Looking forward to it becoming easier. Kinley and I worked well together though, so I'm glad to be finishing up relatively early. (Sleeeeep.)
