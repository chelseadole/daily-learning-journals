# First of all, am I doing the MD "#" thing right yet? Hopefully this shows up better this time. Okay, today was decent. I feel better about the DOM-related stuff than yesterday, and the OOP coding today was overall good. I'm worried about falling behind because it feels like I make good headway most days until around 3pm, then get stuck. It's pretty frustrating. That said, even though this whole salmon cookies project is difficult, I'm enjoying the challenge. -Chelsea
