# LJ Day 19

Today was the last working day of Code Fellows, the 4th day of project week. A pretty short day: we only really did some last-minute cleanup of the page, finished stylizing the Testimonials page, and fixed a small bug. We're actually getting ready to leave now, when it's only 3:15pm. Pretty nice to get a few hours off before the presentations tomorrow.

We practiced presenting today as well, and have a schedule/outline of a script for us to follow. I feel pretty good about how our project looks overall, and I'm excited to show people!
