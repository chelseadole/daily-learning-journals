# Day 15 LJ

Today was the last day of lecture, which we spent learning of the things we'll learn in 301, and also being tortured by the knowledge how much easier life is with jQuery.

Also I was excited to start thinking out my project with Abdul and Max. We decided to call our dog buddy-matching site "Barks and Recreation," and have fleshed out some ideas for how we want to format and code it. I'm pretty excited to get started. :)
