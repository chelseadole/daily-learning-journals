Today has been a good catch-up day for me. I left my Bus Mall project with some gaping holes the other day, but by around 3:00 today I had finished up yesterday's work, and was able to start working on making the chart for today. The chart went relatively smoothly. I was having problems with errors, but i feel I'm able to work more of them out myself now than I was two weeks ago â€” using console logs, etc.

Overall I'm just glad we're leaving Pat and his stupid salmon cookies far, far away in the dust. This project is much clearer to me. Also, I'm excited to get started on a group project! It'll be cool to see my work and ideas come to something tangible beyond hitting requirements/spec.
