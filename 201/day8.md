# I thought lecture today made sense, but then I went to lunch, and when I came back I basically forgot everything. I found the HTML elements of today's work to be fairly straightforward, but when I had to connect the <form> I made, I had a lot of trouble understanding how to connect the JS. I didn't 100% finish the project, but I feel I'll understand it when we do code review tomorrow. -Chelsea
