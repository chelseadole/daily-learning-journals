Today was extremely frustrating, as I felt confident about my logic going into the Bus Mall project, and I felt pretty proud of my code and how efficient it was. It even worked, until I had to try to add the point-counting attribute, keeping stats of various items/clicks. It could be done through my way, but it was just... ugly. So I abandoned that and started over, but with the change in logic I really had a very hard time understanding what I should do. It was a hit to my confidence and "good feeling" going into this week, since in the beginning of the day I was feeling good about feeling like I had improved at coding in the past two weeks, only to feel that it was by less than I'd hoped. I didn't complete the day's project, and left feeling pretty frustrated and down overall.
