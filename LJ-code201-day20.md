# LJ 20

Today was the last day of Code 201! Pretty crazy how much we've learned. I think our presentation went pretty well, though I was really sad to have to leave early and not get to see everybody's presentations. Glad I'll have the videos.

Overall I'm really glad to have this next week off, but I'm looking forward to 301 coming up. I'm very proud of what I've accomplished so far, and also really have bonded with people in the group. I'm really glad I'm with the people I'm with :)
