# Daily Learning Journal, Day 1

Today was a good first day back. I can tell we're still ramping up, and I'm glad that Shayne and I did our pair programming project today instead of waiting until tomorrow because we totally fucked it up a bit with folders and general github annoyance. That said, I really enjoyed the code wars assignment, even though it ended up being easier that I'd initially thought. I can tell that I'll like doing them, and figuring out the puzzles. After pair programming and code wars, I did the readings, and the Shay Howe one especially was great.

I'm going to leave now, and do some of my personal portfolio at home, then in lab tomorrow morning.
