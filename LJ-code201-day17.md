#LJ 17

Today was the second day of project week, and we got a decent amount of work done. I worked exclusively on the results page and the Dogs object in JS today. I had to add a lot more extra information (bios for each built-in dog, resizing photos, etc) in addition to writing a bunch of code using the DOM, and attempting not to suck at CSS.

Group is going well. Today everybody did a bit more solo-style work, which I was thankful for, because I've been a bit sick and wasn't feeling up to doing a ton of talking.

Tomorrow I want to get this project looking good, and finally connect the two halves we've been working with â€” the results/JS part I've been working on with Max, and the form/quiz part that Abdul and Dave have been working on.
