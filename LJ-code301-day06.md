#LJ Code 301, Day 06

Today we learned about AJAX, and used it in tandem with JSON for the first time. As usual, I don't really totally get it yet. However, I'm looking forward to the "click" feeling, when I start to be able to really use it functionally.

I told my boyfriend Jose, who did CF about a year ago, where we are in the class now and he was excited for me, and told me that this section is where JS starts to really feel exciting, and where you're able to manipulate much more. I can see that being true â€” especially with the addition of the APIs we were working with today. I'm pretty excited!
