# LJ Code 301, Day 10

Today was a bit more relaxed than the past two. I think my brain exploded to new levels with all the lecture hours yesterday, so even though I wouldn't call it "chill" it wasn't as mindfucking. I understand SQL joins a bit better now, and I'm excited to start getting good at functional programming using map/filter/reduce. I can tell they'll be very useful in Code Wars stuff too.

Also my new book is good. And so is Zeek's Pizza. (Yum.)
