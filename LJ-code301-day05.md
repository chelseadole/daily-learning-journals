# LJ Code 301, Day 05

Today was a packed day, but then again basically all days here are pretty packed. Pair programming this morning went well. There were fewer TODOs than normal, so Kinley and I finished our our project yesterday. That meant I got to work on my portfolio this morning instead. It's looking pretty nice I think!

Code review stuff wasn't super helpful today (except for the beginning with learning to do tiled displays), but lecture was great! Glad we did a few more of the TODOs than normal, so Monday won't be too insane.
