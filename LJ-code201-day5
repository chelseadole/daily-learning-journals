# LJ Day 5 08/11/17

Today was a good day! In class we worked with text/more CSS. However, I think the most learning happened in the lab. Today I feel like I better internalized git's functionality (and got better at using branches) and also got to improve my programming logic thought the lab questions. I found that working with loops was... if not easy, then not TOO hard... for me. I'm excited to get back to working on my About Me page, because I have some ideas about how I want to stylize my page if I have time.
