# LJ Code 301, Day 09

Yesterday was a hard day at CF. I like the care put into teaching here, and found the first part of the day extremely helpful. However, I think my mind just ran out of space to take in information in the second half. It helped to make something from the ground up. I really wish we got to work with building things from the ground up (versus TODOs) more often. I think the repetition of starting a project (even if it seems boring — setting up the server.js, the files, etc) really helps cement how I would do it "for real."

On the bright side, I've been reading a lot lately. Kind of a crazy amount, honestly. I've read two full length novels in the last 3 days ('The Martian', and 'Howl's Moving Castle') — on the busses to CF, and at home for hours at night. I think it's because I'm kind of sick of screens when I get home, and sometimes don't even want to Netflix it up. I used to read a lot more when I was younger, but haven't for a while (life, college, laziness, friends, etc) so it feels nice to be reading so much again, even if it's not necessarily a good use of my time. I just started a 3rd book today on the bus, 'American Gods', by Neil Gaiman. I actually have read it before, but several years ago, and I want to watch the new TV show so I should re-read first.
