# LJ, Day 13 (Chelsea)

Today we added persistence to our Bus Mall project, and worked using Pair Programming again. I really enjoyed Pair Programming today! I worked with Shayne, and we had a lot of fun. It went kind of slowly at first, and I initially found the whole conceptual idea of what we were even trying to accomplish difficult. However (with Caleb's help especially) we got a lot done and in the end, both of our code worked. :)

ALL HAIL BUS MALL

I really hope to get better at CSS. I asked Shayne if I can fork one of his past projects, so I can poke around and better understand how he achieved the work he did. As a visual learner, I think I'll get a lot out of just looking through somebody else's completed project.

Also I've been getting excited about a personal project I want to work on. Maybe during break week, if I'm not too tired.
