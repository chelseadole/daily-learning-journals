# LJ Code 301, Day 02

Today we learned about jQuery, and I misallocated time by fiddling around with CSS that wasn't really required for the portfolio project. Maybe not my best idea ever, honestly, but I did make it look pretty nice. I'm trying to get the jQuery constructor to add to the DOM.

Tomorrow I want to get some clarification about appending via jQuery, and where you do (and don't) need to make things functions.
