# Day 18 LJ

Today we achieved MVP, and overall got a lot done. We still have some polishing to do (stylizing all the pages so they look more like each other, filling out our bios in the About Me, etc) but mostly we're good to go. I'm overall happy with what we have so far. Our team also got along well today, and I think we all had some nice moments of success.

Tomorrow I really want to practice presenting as well as try out our site on the projector. I'm really bummed that I'll be missing most presentations on Friday to catch my flight to CA. I'm excited to be going of course, but I will definitely watch the project presentation vids online after. :)
