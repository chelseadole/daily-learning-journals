#LJ Code 301, Day 13

Today we learned to deploy stuff through Heroku, which turned out to be actually pretty easy to use. The lab was of normal difficulty today.

GOD am I glad that we're done working on the Kilvolt blog. I am definitely over that. Looking forward to building some stuff from scratch starting tomorrow, and also to project week! I think my group is going to be pretty ambitious, but we're all pretty excited about the idea so I'm excited.
