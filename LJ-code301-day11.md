# LJ Code 301, Day 11

I felt kind of unmotivated today. I've been feeling worn out, and a bit worried about being able to last through 10 weeks of 401. That said, the lab and code wars problem went relatively quickly today.

On another note, I somehow managed to lose my phone in the trash can?? It's been a weird day.
