#LJ Code 301, Day 19

Yesterday was a back-and-forth kind of day. We started out very ambitious, and wanted to restructure the way we were interpreting data. However, after two hours of Nathan and I achieving nothing towards that end, we changed tracks. After that, I worked on integrating the filter data more, and actually started on some CSS at the end of the day.

The site looks pretty shit (really shit) but there's something on the page now. :)
