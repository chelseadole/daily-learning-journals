#LJ Code 301, Day 16

Today was day 1 of project week. I started on date-time stuff, which I expected to be kind of boring/quick, but... was not. As is the essence of date time I suppose.

I thought I'd just need to find a library, but it turns out that the problems that JS date libraries (like Moment) are built to solve are more aimed at how the date looks appended to the DOM, not transferring the date's content from form to form. Damn.

That said, with Megan's help I was able to get a decent amount done. I configured date time using today's Date() object and through a .get request to our SQL database of all AA meetings, and also made a filter that looks through it and returns only meetings after the current hour, but before the end of the day.

Nathan was pretty stressed today. It took me a bit by surprise, because he's a total coding badass. He got a lot done, but I think that because the project is personal for him, he really wants to tear through it. Though we figured out the server problem we were having by the end (thank goodness!) it took quite a few quick mental health breaks (good for everybody) and refactoring/group discussions.

Overall I think the group is working well together though.
