# LJ, Day 14 (Chelsea)

Overall today was hard, and felt a bit... disparate. I'm excited to be learning the new functions and their implementation in functional programming, but felt a bit surprised by how the routine of the course seemed to change in the day's lab (being a one-day, "spin off" project almost). Max, Abdul, and I hit a few really difficult bugs. We stayed to the evening, but after a while even several TA's couldn't figure out what the hell was going on, and we decided to turn in what we had and revisit sometime this weekend.

Hard to believe tomorrow is the last day of class! Wow. Three weeks has really flown by. It's crazy to think how much I've learned, and also how much I could/will learn in many more weeks at Code Fellows.
