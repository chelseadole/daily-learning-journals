# LJ Code 301, Day 08

Yesterday I was feeling sick, so when we got out of class at 4pm (with no portfolio) I went straight home. I reeeeeally hope I'm not actually sick, because I lose a lot of motivation when I'm sick and CF isn't really a place where you can lose motivation.

I like the server stuff, but I also don't totally understand it. Glad we're (right now at this moment) starting this grocery store demo. I think it seems very helpful.
