#LJ, Code 301, Day 17

Whew. We got quite a bit done today. Nathan + Matt really tackled the GoogleMaps API portion, and I feel pretty good about the stuff I got done with the form, jQuery, and changes to the data controller. :)

Much tea was drank today.

Also, sadly, we ran into Nathan's Law. (Multiple times.)
