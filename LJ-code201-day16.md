# Day 16

Today was day one of project week. My team mates (Max W., Dave J., and Abdul) and I are starting our project, and it has gone well so far. Max and I got started on the JS in the first part of the day while Abdul and Dave did HTML/CSS stuff. Near the second half, we switched off. We got through the most essential parts of the JS and tomorrow we should finish the event listeners/quiz functionality.

My personal goal with this project is to make it look very nice. Based on our first day success, I think we'll be successful on getting our site to work. (Knock on wood.) But I was pretty inspired by seeing some of the older 201 projects, and I haven't yet made a project that I feel has excellent visual design, and I'd like to do that.
