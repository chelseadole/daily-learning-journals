# Day 2 LJ, Chelsea Dole

Today was more challenging than yesterday -- especially with CSS, which I essentially still suck at. However, I am finding the challenge to be fun. I got stuck on the JS for loop, and though it took me a while of frustration, figuring it out made it worth it.

Also, git got mildly easier today. So success?
