# LJ, Code 301, Day 03

Today was a better day because I didn't forget my food and by extension all my energy/patience. I think I got a lot out of the lab this morning that I did with Michael. We worked well together, and I understand how to manipulate HTML using jQuery much better now. I was also excited to see the work we were doing with event handling in jQuery in class today. In the past ~1 hr since the end of lecture, I've been able to make some nice spec (and personal) goals with my portfolio.

Overall a great day!
