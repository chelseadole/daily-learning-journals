#Chelsea Dole

Today was hard... currently writing this from CF at 10pm and writing this feels like screaming into the void a little bit. I wasn't able to do as much on Salmon Cookies as I'd like to, but tomorrow I'm really determined to get this project: (1) fixed better than now, and (2) looking better via css.
